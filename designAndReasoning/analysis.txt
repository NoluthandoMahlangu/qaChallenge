   UX designer

-What is the end-to-end design flow
-Want to see the high level architecture on how everything will function end-to-end
-What approch or desing is used to show end-to-end implementation of the feature

2. I would want it to be as simple to use and easy to navigate to each component
   Ensure that each component is using a function that is desired for.

3. Adding user to - after adding user i want to see the list of added users and be able to edit any user on the list if i made a mistake and get the updated list.
   Delete if there are captures eg are you sure you want to delete then done.
