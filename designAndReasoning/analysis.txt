1. Product owner
-How does their feature improves users experience end-to-end
-What are the future priorities for this particular system

   UX designer
-How will they ensure the feature is user friendly and not complex to the end user
-Is the usability and functionality seamless to the the end user
-Would all these requirements be in a form of a link, button also would they be on the same page or multiple pages


   Technical architecture
-What security measures are in place for the feature(if details are encrypted)
-What is the end-to-end design flow
-Want to see the high level architecture on how everything will function end-to-end
-What approach or design is used to show end-to-end implementation of the feature
-If the user deletes and want to add their details does the system pick details or you start from scratch

2. I would want it to be as simple to use and easy to navigate to each component
   Ensure that each component is using a function that is desired for.

3. I will automate all these abilities
